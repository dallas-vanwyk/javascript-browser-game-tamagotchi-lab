/* 
It’s a one-player game.
The player is tasked with keeping a creature happy.
Each creature a player ‘raises’ has three main statistics.
The stats are:
Boredom
Hunger
Sleepiness
To keep the creature happy, a player must keep three stats within a given range - greater than 0 and less than 10.

Minimum Requirements

[] Display three buttons when the page is initially displayed.
[] Display three stats that randomly increment a value between 0 and 3 at a set interval.
[] A player can click a button to set the corresponding stat to 0.
[] Include loss logic and display a message when the player has lost.
[] Provide a Play Again button that will reset the game.

// 1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game.

// 2) Store cached element references.

// 3) Upon loading, the game state should be initialized, and a function should 
//    be called to render this game state.

// 4) The state of the game should be rendered to the user.

// 5) Handle the game over logic. 

// 6) Handle each instance of a player clicking a button with the use of a 
//    `handleClick()` function.

// 7) Create reset functionality.
